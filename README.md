# moon-picture
Aim of this project is to clarify moon pictures

Currently model for clarifying pictures is trained for landscape images for https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theblackmamba31/landscape-image-colorization

To Do:

Train for full-moon pictures from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatkumar30/phases-of-moon-picture-dataset

For further improvement a discriminator will be trained and GAN model will be used instead of this one.
